# ImageProcessing-Transformation
This project visualizes 2D transformations on a square using NumPy and Matplotlib. It includes similarity (scale, rotate, translate), projective (homography), Euclidean (rigid: rotate + translate), and affine (scale, shear, rotate) transforms. Plots show how each transformation affects shape geometry.
